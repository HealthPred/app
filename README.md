# HEALTHPRED - Predict your Health at ease

We propose a mobile app, which aims to alert clinicians and
doctors about the likelihood of particular health conditions of
patients.
The mobile app will also help doctors to predict the likelihood
of a patient being readmitted to the hospital and predict the
future outcomes of the patient.

The app will take the patient parameters as input and predict
the chances for the ‘X’ patient to develop a ‘Y’ disease.
The app will take into account the patient'
s symptoms, and predicts a potential disease.
This helps clinicians and doctors with effective resource
allocation in hospitals for patients and fast decision-making.
